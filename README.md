# Abstract-Data-Structures
Abstract Data Structures created using C++. The repo will include all the abstract data structures such as Trees, Graphs, linked lists, etc and the algorithms associated with them.
One can clone the code or directly copy it to run the C++ implementation.
Currently there is only implementation code on Linked Lists.

I am making everything from scratch. Some of the new files in the recent commit have errors. They don't give correct answers. I have actually stopped working on these for a while because I am working on a project. I will get back to it ASAP. clone at your own risk.
