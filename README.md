# Abstract-Data-Structures
Abstract Data Structures created using C++. The repo will include all the abstract data structures such as Trees, Graphs, linked lists, etc and the algorithms associated with them.
One can clone the code or directly copy it to run the C++ implementation.
Currently there is only implementation code on Linked Lists.
