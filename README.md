# Abstract-Data-Structures and Algorithms

I am trying to create a repository with Data structures and algorithms from scratch. I am actively working over this library right now. Feel free to help in anyway possible. I am revisiting my Algorithms lessons and doing this helps me revise better. This also helps me practice and stay connected to C++.

The entire library is to be written in C++ but if I feel the need I might adjust the repo to include code in Python as well as C languages.

I do not have any plan in regards to it's structure or where to start off. I am currently sticking to learning from CLRS and Coursera and whatever DS or A comes my way I will implement it into the repo after learning of it.
